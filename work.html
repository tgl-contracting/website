                  <p class="light">The Makara Peak Mountain Bike Park is an award winning, purpose built recreational space set in 250 hectares of native bush in the capital city of Wellington.  Visited by nearly 100,000 people each year; bikers, runners and walkers, it is recognised as a world class Mountain Bike park.</p>
                  <p class="light">Makara Peak has grown to need a long term committed and skilled contractor. As the needs of the park have developed so has TGL. Establishing procedures and close working relationships between Wellington City Council, the Makara Peak supporters and the public, TGL provides mountain bike track maintenance and construction services to keep the park in world class condition. The status of preferred contractor has been hard earned and now enables us to provide even better value and dependability for a key resource for the region.</p>
                  <p class="light">For the past five years, TGL has worked closely with WCC and the supporters to deliver the highest value for the limited funds available. TGL’s knowledge of the park is always growing and we are constantly trying to exceed the maintenance needs as the traffic and user numbers increase.</p>

                  <p class="light">The park needed a more direct, and yet accessible (grade 3) climbing trail in tough terrain. This culminated in the construction of a 73m suspension bridge. TGL worked closely with the Makara Peak supporters and the Wellington City Council with surfacing adjustments of the lower section and complete construction and surfacing of the upper half.</p>
                  <p class="light">It was a technically challenging project, chiselled and cut into solid rock, it required large scale rock excavation, bridge construction and drainage systems.  TGL also had to re-develop and align existing tracks within the broader Makara Peak network, ensuring ‘rider experience continuity’ - making it easier for more people to ride single track to the top of the peak!</p>
                  <p class="light">The track was officially opened in March 2017, and has become one of the most popular routes for riders to access Makara Peak and now provides a continual grade 3 loop for visitors to the park.</p>

Due to its popularity and local weather conditions the track required urgent, immediate and significant maintenance and remedial repairs. TGL stepped in to take on the short and long term upkeep of this track, which has proved to be the most used downhill track in the park. TGL works closely with WCC and developed an ongoing monitoring and maintenance schedule and budget.</p>

                  <p class="light">The Wellington Mountain Bike Club, Wellington City Council and the Mt Vic Super D event organisers wanted a unique race line with specific built features integrated into a technical trail, whilst maintaining grade specific continuity for an event.</p>
                  <p class="light">The majority of the grade 4 trail is off camber with tree roots, and natural features.  It required retaining, benching, shaping and the most ambitious part of this project was a race only ‘road gap’; a temporary structure on permanent foundations allowing riders to jump over a wide dual use track. This feature is removable and had to be lined up perfectly to ensure a race line that would land riders safely on the other side. With a very  tight timeline for construction, full testing had to be completed before the event. The feature is only operational when marshals and safety barriers are in place. In the end the feature and the new trail were resounding success and the disassembly of the ‘road gap’ was done easily following the event.</p>
